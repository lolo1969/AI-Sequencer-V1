Create a slow, evolving sequence in the style of Philip Glass. Use repeating arpeggios and minimal harmonic changes to build a meditative atmosphere. The rhythm should be steady but not mechanical, with subtle variations over time. Keep the dynamics soft and flowing, letting layers overlap gradually. Focus on consonant harmonies and smooth transitions, evoking a sense of timelessness and quiet intensity.
